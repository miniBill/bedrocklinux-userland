brm ("BedRock Merge")
======================

brm provides the ability to merge etcfiles from clients into the core,
mainly passwd, shadow and group.

Usage
-----

To use run:

    brm <client-name> <command-to-run>

Configuration
-------------

If there exists a root-owned file at

    /bedrock/clients/etc/clients.d/<client-name>.conf

brc will allow users to run software from that client, switching out local
context files accordingly.  If this file does not exist or is writable by
anyone other than root, brc will refuse to operate.  Be sure the client's files
exist at /bedrock/clients/<client-name> and that brs has set it up
(check bri -s <client-name>).  This should "just work" on a properly setup
Bedrock Linux system.

Installation
------------

Bedrock Linux should be distributed with a script which handles installation,
but just in case:

The dependencies are:

- libcap (can be found here: https://sites.google.com/site/fullycapable/)
- libbedrock (should be distributed with this)

To compile, run

    make

To install into installdir, run

    make prefix=<installdir> install

Then proceed to use "setcap" to set the "cap_sys_chroot=ep" capability on the
installed brc executable.

To clean up, like usual:

    make uninstall

And finally, to remove it, run:

    make prefix=<installdir> uninstall
